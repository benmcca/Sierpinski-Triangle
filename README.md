# Sierpinski-Triangle
Python program using Turtle to display the formation of a Sierpinski Triangle.

Inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs

This program models the famous Sierpinski Triangle. 
The way it works is by starting at a random point in the triangle and randomly selecting another corner of the triangle. The program then places a dot at the midpoint of these two points. From that point, it continues to randomly select another corner of the triangle and draw the midpoint between the two points. 

By taking a user input for the number of dots, this will decide how many dots end up being drawn on the canvas.
